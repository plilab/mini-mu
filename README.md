# MiniMu

MiniMu is an experimental language of construction and destruction to explore the dual lambda-mu calculus.

## Setup

Run ```make build``` to build the project and its dependencies.

## Testing

To run all test cases, run script ```make test-all``` in your terminal.

To run a specific file, run script ```make run FILE=<test-file> [STEP= true | false ]```.
`STEP` defaults to false - setting it to true will make it display all steps of the program evaluation.
