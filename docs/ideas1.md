# Ideas

This is a documentation file that contains the ideas for the projects, including
those have been implemented and those still haven't been implemented.
Some of the ideas are still at very early stage and might be wrong.

## Goals

- Implement a nice language
- Discover how to use the language well

- Interpreter
- Improve Syntax
  - Fewer brackets
  - Be more pretty
  - Look at Haskell or OCaml
  - No have to go through command within each mu. E.g., by designating a current continuation or current expression
- Syntactic Sugar
- Develop Examples
  - Large example (e.g., a parser)
  - Want to discover what idioms to use
    - In particular find ways that the duality is actually an advantage
      - Example, map and fold can be written in accumulator style or not
- Letrec
- Debugger
- GraphViz to see evaluation
- Side Effects (but that might be a bad idea)
- Look at Duo for syntax examples
- Protocol implementations
- Multi-thread webserver (combine concurrency with protocols)
- Static Type checker
- Declare data types?
  - Does this matter if we don't have a type checker?
- Automated testing system
